        I think the way girls define their first love is weird. The equation will not simply be drawn as the first boyfriend you got is your first love. It’s more complicated than that. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">I think to me first love is the person who left a mark on your heart, and it would take a very long time for that mark to be erased away.  </p>
    
        <p class="stories">
        I met him at an art prep school. I still remember that day. He was late to the orientation meeting. He wore a white shirt. His feet was injured so he walked in with a walking stick, backlit. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">I couldn’t really see his face, but that moment struck me. It was definitely love on the first sight. He was held back one year, so he’s older than everyone else in the class. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">Later on other people from the same grade  told me he had a girlfriend. So I kept that feeling to myself.</p> 
            
        <p class="stories">The next fall I was admitted by an international art school, I didn’t know he was admitted by the same school until I saw him on the school shuttle. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">Rumor said his girlfriend was trying to get into the same school, but failed and moved to other city. They decided they’d do long distance at that time.</p>

        <p class="stories">We didn’t talk much at first. Our paths didn’t really overlap till the second semester. The school festival was coming up. He hit me up through some mutual friends, asking if I’d want to form a band with him. He wanted me to be the vocal.</p>
    
            
        <p class="stories">I could definitely sing, and I have confidence in my voice. So I said yes. I had a crush on him, it’s so hard to reject. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">He always looked clean, neat and cute. And he dressed like guys in Japanese dramas, you know, in shibu-caji style... But anyways, we didn’t have any resources, knowledge or experience with forming a band; all we knew was that we wanted to perform. That was a brand new experience for me: it was the first time I didn’t really think of consequences and just jumped in. </p>
        
        <p class="stories">He definitely brought a lot of exciting first-time moments like that to me. Even we stayed platonic until the very end. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">We went to see a lot underground live music, also music festivals: whenever we got time we tried to go to as many lives as we can. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">And then our band made a little success: we were on air on some shows of CCTV, made some headlines... And eventually we were just naturally drawn to each other after all these rehearsals, concerts, nervous moments and adventures we shared together... then we became a thing.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">We made a promise to fly the kite when spring comes. It’s from the song of Sodagreen, called Incomparable Beauty. Something like “a kite <br/>flyies in the sky, we just chase it on the ground; <br/>if you worry that you can’t fly, baby you got <br/>my butterflies.” </p>
            
        <p class="stories">But we never made it come true. I’ve never flied a kite with anyone till today. It feels like something I had to accomplish with him, at least for the first time. Just like what we always used to do.</p>
    
        <p class="stories">He didn’t break up with his girlfriend, and it didn’t seem like he was going to. I didn’t care because I really liked him. Love is love, I thought to myself. As long as these amazing bubbly moments could last, I will pretend nothing else is going wrong.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">But things eventually went wrong. It was two months in our “relationship”, there was one time I checked his social media. I don’t know why I did that. I never really paid any attention to it before. Not like most girls, I usually don’t go through my love interests’ post history and feed. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">Then I found out his girlfriend commented below every single post he made. All of the sudden I sobered up, I didn’t realize till that moment our relationship wasn’t only about us, there’s always been another person.</p>
            
        <p class="stories">Or actually, I was the other person, the one that involved into a relationship that already existed before my arrival. My pleasure was built upon someone else’s pain. The guilt sinked in, and it eventually got me.</p>
    
        <p class="stories">I went through some struggles, then decided to give him the ultimatum: it’s either me or her. I couldn’t think of a better way. The only thing I knew was that things can’t keep going like that. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">If we were going to be together, I wished that he’d make up his mind and make things between us official, make things right. otherwise I’ll back off. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">He said he couldn’t do it. He had been with that girl for some years, he knew the love wasn’t there anymore, but it’s hard to break the truth.</p>
    
        <p class="stories">We were in a 85C cafe when having this conversation. I was sitting faced to the window. The sunlight was too harsh to my eyes. He noticed that and asked to switch seats. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">He talked to me about his thoughts of his own future. He always had a lot of thoughts, weird ideas and dreams. And he always had the drive and due diligence to make them happen. I know that’s why I’ll always be drawn to him, again and again. It’s like gravity. But I know I can’t keep things unclear anymore, I didn’t want to.</p> 
            
        <p class="stories">So I broke up with him. </p>
          
        <p class="stories">A week later, my ex was pursuing me. I didn’t think much and said yes. I just wanted to get over him as soon as possible. He broke up with his girlfriend right after that. Then he wanted me back. I said no. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">A lot of mutual friends of ours all came to talk to me, saying he was in a really dark place, that he started smoking and drinking, even crying in the dorm. I still stood by my choice. I said he’ll be fine by himself, he’ll move on. In my head I was thinking he didn’t make it right when I offered him the chance, the chance for him to choose me. That’s all that matter. I admit I was petty.</p>
    
        <p class="stories">He still cared about me in his own way even we were not together anymore. He couldn’t show the care directly like he used to, but he tried anyways. There was one time he wrote a letter to my boyfriend back then. It might sound weird but he meant good. He basically wrote about things I like, things I hate, my little habits... And told him to treat me nicely, always.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">I remember one time, a week before the college entrance test. He got me a bag of skittles and left a note in my desk: “This is for you. I spit in it. Good luck with the exam.” You know, he was like a little boy, confused and didn’t know how to address his feelings directly, but he tried.</p>
          
        <p class="stories">We eventually added each other back on wechat and started talking way later. I was depressed for a long time. I’d dream of him and cry at night. My friends can’t even mention his name in front of me. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">It's not that some “new love” healed me. I never really forget about him. Time just does its work. </p>
            
        <p class="stories">It’s more like I internalized this pain till it’s not sharp and hurting anymore, along with all the happiness and memories of him. </p>
    
        <p class="stories">And that becomes part of me that I still live with nowadays. It’s as if I come out living with a heavier, yet bigger and loving heart. It’s amazing.</p>
