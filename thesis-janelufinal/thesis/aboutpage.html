        This is the thesis project presented by Jane Lu, from CCA Graphic Design 2020 Thesis class. <br/><br/>
        
        This project aims to acknowledge the pains and growth individuals went through, sacrifices they made, effort they put into their “failed” relationships through the form of storytelling. As I build up a collective voices of survivors’ stories, I hope to engage the storytellers and the audiences to look at and interpret these stories, to learn from them, to heal from them, to find the bounce back force, and grow from them.<br/><br/>
            
        This publication will be an ongoing project, and we're always looking for new voices to come in. So if you see something inspiring, and also want to share your lived experiences, send a message to <a>bigjane1218@gmail.com</a>.
